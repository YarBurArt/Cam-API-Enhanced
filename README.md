# Cam-Hackers ==> Cam-API-Enhanced

Hack Cameras, so said the original author. 

But this script just conveniently parses insecam.org , and I rewrote and cleaned up for vanilla pypy3. It still has a few vulnerabilities, try to find them in the script and you'll understand how it works :) 

<h3> Run Command: </h3>

```bash
apt-get install python3
# or apt-get install pypy3
apt-get install git

git clone https://github.com/YarBurArt/Cam-API-Enhanced.git

cd Cam-Hackers
python3 cam_hackers.py 
# or pypy3 cam_hackers.py or py cam_hackers.py
```
# CAM-HACKERS

**My apologies, the quality ate up the privacy suite.**

But the base and the idea is still with these authors
